A landmark text for revolutionaries and activists, The Wretched of the Earth is an eternal touchstone for civil rights, anti-colonialism, psychiatric studies, and Black consciousness movements around the world. Alongside Cornel West?s introduction, the book features critical essays by Jean-Paul Sartre and Homi K. Bhabha. This sixtieth anniversary edition of Fanon?s most famous text stands proudly alongside such pillars of anti-colonialism and anti-racism as Edward Said?s Orientalism and The Autobiography of Malcolm X. .

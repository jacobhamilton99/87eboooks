Thus began one of the strangest odysseys in publishing history.The book, called ?one of the most chilling things I have ever read? by Barbara Walters, skyrocketed up bestseller lists across the country in fall 2007 as the national media relentlessly covered O.J. Simpson?s dramatic Las Vegas arrest for armed robbery and kidnapping.Originally written by O.J. Simpson, this edition includes essays by the Goldmans and a member of the Goldman family legal team that reveal the fascinating story behind the bankruptcy case, the book?s publication and the looming court proceedings, that would eventually lead to his conviction. .

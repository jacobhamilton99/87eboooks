**Book Synopsis** : This indispensable volume is a lucid and faithful account of the Buddha?s teachings. ?For years,? says the Journal of the Buddhist Society, ?the newcomer to Buddhism has lacked a simple and reliable introduction to the complexities of the subject. Dr. Rahula?s What the Buddha Taught fills the need as only could be done by one having a firm grasp of the vast material to be sifted. It is a model of what a book should be that is addressed first of all to ?the educated and intelligent reader.? Authoritative and clear, logical and sober, this study is as comprehensive as it is masterly.?This edition contains a selection of illustrative texts from the Suttas and the Dhammapada (specially translated by the author), sixteen illustrations, and a bibliography, glossary and index. .

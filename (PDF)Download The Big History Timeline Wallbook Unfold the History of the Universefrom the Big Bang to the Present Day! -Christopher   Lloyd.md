**Book Synopsis** : IMAGINE TAKING a trip through the history of everything from the beginning of the universe to the present day! Created in association with the American Museum of Natural History, this unique 'big history' wallbook includes a 6-foot fold-out timeline containing more than 1,000 pictures and captions that tell the story of the history of the world. The timeline is divided into 12 sections covering both natural history as well as the history of human civilizations in each of the world's continents so you can easily compare what was happening across the world at any given moment in time. The Big History Timeline Wallbook also includes an easy-to-read chronicle which reports on more than forty seminal moments from the timeline in the style of a newspaper. Other features include a page of letters to the editor, a fifty-question quiz, and pocket magnifier. Perfect for 6-14 year olds but equally fascinating for all curious adults too. .
